## Overview:
    This is a python program that uses a Tkinter GUI to display a program with two text boxes and a button.
    Using the simple interface, the user can enter a Celsius temperature as a floating point number in the top entry
    field. After hitting the "ºC to F" button, the program will convert the entered Cº temperature into it's
    Fahrenheit equivalent, displaying that number in the output label.
    Clicking the "ºF to ºC button will do the opposite, converting the user input from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
