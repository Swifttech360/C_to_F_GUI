 Write a GUI program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. The user should be able to enter a
  Celsius temperature, click a button, then see the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature. Use the following formula to make
   the conversion(30 points):

F = 9/5 * C + 32

F is the Fahrenheit temperature, and C is the Celsius temperature.

 You should allow the user to enter a generic temperature and have two buttons -- one to treat the input as Fahrenheit
 and convert it to Celsius; and one to treat the input as Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit.


To submit your assignment:

  Submit your source code file for each program (*.py), please name the .py file using the name LNameFnameM#_M#Ex#
  (using your name).
 Submit screenshots demonstrating your program works correctly. Any program that requires user input should be run a
  minimum of three times with varying test values. Screenshots may be embedded in a document for submission or submitted
   individually.
